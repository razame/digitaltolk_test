My thoughts about the code are.

-------------------------- What makes initial codebase great -------------------------
1. Code is great in the sense that we are using repositories and controllers.
   Repositories contain the generic methods and controllers are calling them.
2. Using Dependency Injection through constructor. This makes the code decoupled,
   reusable and testable.
3. Using env() method to utilize the variables that are needed on various
   locations throughout the application.
4. Using the Eloquent ORM in the application that provides many extended utilities
   like calling the model events and using relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------- Things that needed improvement --------------------------
1. Using nested if statements makes the code un-readable and un-maintainable. Now we
   are using the early return strategy. If the fail case condition meets return the
   control to "initial code scope" or the "parent method".
2. Using the variable names like "$cuser" (that are not very well described) makes the
   code as usual hard to understand and takes a lot of mental effort to gain the
   context of what is happening. So for the time being we have modified the variable
   name to "$cUser" that makes it a little-bit descriptive. We could have used the
   variable name as "$customerUserObject" but we didn't do that because there were
   some other variables which look same and renaming the variable could have created
   some inconsistencies in the code.
3. Using env() method is good but using config() is far better option.
4. Long sequence of instructions in a method is bad. It becomes tedious to understand
   what is going on. The code with same context should be inside a method having
   self-explanatory name and that method should replace that code. That is what we
   have done at a couple of places inside the code.
5. Instead of using $request->all() we should use $request->only() method to get the
   values only those fields which we are going to save as the result of submitting
   the form.
6. There were a couple of occasions where the methods of BookingRepository were being
   called inside itself like this $this->bookingRepository->method() which we can call
   as $this->method(). So we have eradicated this issue as well.
7. Instead of using Illuminate\Http\Request wherever it is possible we should use
   custom Request classes like BookingRequest so that we can easily define the rules of
   validation for that request and the code look clean and modular.
8. In some scenarios instead of using multiple if statements we can use polymorphism
   using key-value pair strategy.
9. Variables should be defined as close to their first usage if we are utilizing it
   fewer times. In other case we should make global variables inside the functions
   scope.
10. In some scenarios not declaring a variable is more suitable option. Like if we
    copy a variable and the copied variable is not serving the different purpose to
    the application, then this variable should not be declared.
11. If statements having single expression inside them should be replaced with the
    ternary operator or null coalescing operator to increase readability.
12. Complexity of the readability of nested if statements can also be reduced by using
    combined conditions. Like
    ----------------------------------------------------
    $pronouns = '';
    if ( !is_null($gender) )
    {
        if ($gender === 'male') {
            $pronouns = 'Him';
        }
        if ($gender === 'female') {
            $pronouns = 'Her';
        }
    }
    ----------------------------------------------------
    $pronouns = '';
    if ( !is_null($gender) && $gender === 'male')
        $pronouns = 'Him';

    if ( !is_null($gender) && $gender === 'female')
        $pronouns = 'Her';
    ----------------------------------------------------
13. Instead of using negative expression inside if statement like
    if(!empty($job->user_email)){}
    we should use the positive statements and the negative statements can be moved to
    else statement. Correcting this issue results in clear understanding in the first
    go.
14. Instead of concatenate the variable with the string like this.
    -----
    $subject = 'Information om avslutad tolkning för bokningsnummer # ' . $job->id;
    ---
    we should write this statement like this.
    ---
    $subject = "Information om avslutad tolkning för bokningsnummer # $job->id";

There are various other ways to refactor the code which we didn't mention here due
to time limitation and non-working isolated files.
